"""Builders and fakes shared by this repo's tests.

Why this module exists
----------------------
Before it, every test that needed an index entry hand-wrote the same nested
dict, and every test that needed an HTTP response hand-wrote the same stub
class. That is fine once and a liability by the tenth time: when the shape of
a series entry changes, the change has to be found in a dozen literals spread
across several files, and the ones that are missed fail in ways that look like
product bugs.

Everything here is a *builder with defaults*, not a fixed fixture. Call it
with no arguments for a plausible object; pass only the field the test is
actually about. A test then reads as "a series with two seasons, the second
half-watched" rather than forty lines of dict.

Adding to this module
---------------------
Keep builders total (every field has a working default) and keep them free of
assertions -- a builder that validates makes failures surface in setup rather
than in the test. Fakes record what they were asked for so a test can assert
on the call, not just the result.
