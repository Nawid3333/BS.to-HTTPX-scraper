"""Timing benchmarks for the paths where cost actually scales.

Skipped unless ``--benchmark`` is passed. See ``tests/bench.py`` for the
harness, the tolerance, and how to re-record the baseline.

What belongs here
-----------------
Work whose cost grows with the size of the index or of a page, and where a
regression would be invisible in a correctness test: the episode parser (run
once per season page, thousands of times per full scrape), the merge (walks
every episode of every series), and the index load/save (a 19 MB file here).

What does not belong here: anything touching the network, anything whose
runtime is dominated by sleeps, and micro-benchmarks of functions called a
handful of times per run -- they add noise and maintenance for no signal.

Every benchmark builds its input once, outside the timed callable, so the
number reflects the operation and not the setup.
