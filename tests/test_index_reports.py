"""What the change report and the mismatch report actually print.

These paths were the largest untested block in index_manager. They are worth
covering because they are the last thing standing between a scrape and a
destructive answer: the user decides what to approve from these lines, so a
line that reports the wrong count, silently drops a series, or renders an
empty section is a bug with real consequences even though nothing crashes.

Style note for future edits
---------------------------
Assert on *facts* in the output -- a title being present, a count being
right -- rather than on exact strings. Pinning whole formatted lines makes
every cosmetic change a test failure, which trains people to update tests
without reading them. Where the exact shape genuinely matters (the S1E2
notation, the Sub/WL flags) it is asserted directly and the test says why.
