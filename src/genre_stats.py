"""Genre statistics for bs.to (menu option 7).

Self-contained by design: this module composes the existing scraper, index and
atomic-write helpers, and keeps its own data file. Nothing outside it -- other
than the menu wiring in main.py -- is touched, so the series index, the merge
paths and the golden parser fixtures stay exactly as they were.

Genres are read from *series pages*, never from the catalogue listing. The
listing files each series under one genre only; the series page carries all of
them. Every genre counts, all genres count equally, and a series counts in each
of its genres -- so the column totals are deliberately larger than the number of
series.
