# Unset, it resolves to the repo checkout exactly as it always has: this file
# lives in config/, so its parent is the project root. Running from a clone is
# therefore byte-for-byte unchanged.
#
# BS_HOME overrides it, and that is what makes an *installed* copy usable.
# Installed into a venv, config/ sits inside site-packages, where no user can
# reasonably be expected to find a .env to edit; pointing BS_HOME at a real
# folder gives the program a writable home it owns.
