# ==================== SCRAPING SETTINGS ====================
# Measured, not guessed. Two sweeps on one shared login, series shuffled
# per pass and worker counts run in random order:
#
#   250 series x2   4: 11.78   6: 15.78   8: 17.69  12: 18.18  16: 19.32
#   300 series x3                        12: 17.14  16: 16.70  20: 16.30
#                                        24: 16.55  32: 16.61
#
# Throughput climbs steeply to 8, flattens by 12, and is indistinguishable
# from 12 to 32 -- the two sweeps disagree on whether 16 beats 12, which is
# itself the answer: past 12 the differences are session noise, not signal.
# 12 was fastest in the longer sweep and the steadiest there (spread 0.33
# vs 3.12 at 24), so it is the last setting that buys anything real.
#
# The earlier note here recommended 4 on stability grounds from a sweep
# that stopped at 12; the wider sweep shows 4 costs ~35% throughput for
# no benefit. Zero 429/503 was seen anywhere up to 32 workers, so this
# plateau is local saturation, not the site pushing back -- raising it
# further only adds load.
# Past the peak the season fan-out already keeps pool_workers *
# SEASON_CONCURRENCY requests in flight, so more workers only add load.
#
# Where the time actually goes, measured with the built-in PhaseProfiler
# over 300 series x2 shuffled passes at these settings:
#   network 99.5%   parse 0.4%   checkpoint <0.1%
# Parsing costs 7% of ONE core across the run, so the scrape is bound by
# the network and not by this process. Offloading parse off the event loop was
# already measured 2-2.7x SLOWER (see parse_season_html), and the lxml parser
# cut per-page parse time another 3.8x on top, so there is nothing left to
# win here. Do not reopen this without a fresh profile showing otherwise.

# Season pages of one series are independent GETs. Fetching them one after
# another made a series' scrape time scale linearly with its season count,

# flight is NUM_WORKERS * SEASON_CONCURRENCY -- raise either with care, and
# only alongside the RateGuard that reacts to the site pushing back.
